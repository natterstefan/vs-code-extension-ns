# vs-code-extension-ns

This is the README for your extension "vs-code-extension-ns". Currently it is
only capable of saying "Hello" and more of a playground for me. :)

## Features

- Demo extensions saying hello after executing the "Hello World" command

## Requirements

- node 8.11.x

## Extension Settings

Currently the extension does only adds a few VS Code settings through
the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

- `vscodens.text`: defines the text for the HelloWorld command (Default:
  "Hello World :)")
